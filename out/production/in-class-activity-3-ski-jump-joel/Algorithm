user input hill_type normal or large
user input speed as a float
define height, points per meter, and par as 0

% calculate distance for both
if hill_type is large
  then height == 70, points_per_meter == 1.8, par == 120
  time_air = sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
  distance = speed * time_air
  points_earned = 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter
else
  then height = 46, points_per_meter == 2, par == 90
  time_air = sqrt((2*height/9.8))
  distance = speed * time_air
  points_earned = 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter


print distance and points_earned

if points_earned <= 61
  print "Great job for doing better than par!"
elif points_earned < 10
  print "What happened??"
otherwise
  print "Sorry you didnâ€™t go very far"
